There will be five projects during the semester that will count for 50% of your course grade. Unless otherwise indicated, you SHOULD work in a team of two. You may consult general reference material, but you may not collaborate outside your team. The material you turn in MUST be entirely your teamâ€™s work, and you are bound by the Student Code. Please start early.
